## Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, almost every secure transaction (online banking, WhatsApp chats, UPI payments, login passwords, SSL certificates) depends on advanced mathematics and number theory.  
However, most first-year computer science students see mathematics and programming as two separate subjects and do not realize that the same loops, functions, and if-else conditions they are learning are the actual building blocks of modern cryptography.
There is a clear need for simple, beginner-level Python programs that demonstrate real-life cryptographic concepts (prime numbers, modular arithmetic, modular inverse, Chinese Remainder Theorem, primality testing, etc.) so that students can connect classroom theory with real-world cybersecurity applications.

## Scope of the Project

This project consists of 34 independent, well-documented Python programs that cover fundamental and intermediate number-theoretic concepts used in cryptography and information security.

## Target Users
targets users include:
- For 1st year engineering students who are learning basic python and want to see the practical application of their syllabus.
- For teachers who want to use ready-to-use examples for their students.
- Self-learners and enthusiast who are eager or just curious to learn about the mathematics used in hacking and encryption.

## High level features

- Includes core algorithms like Modular Exponentiation, Extended Euclidean, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and Miller-Rabin, the same math used in WhatsApp, and banking apps.

- Features the industry-standard Miller-Rabin test, which is used by real-world tools like OpenSSL to check if huge numbers are prime.

- Identifies composite numbers that fool weak prime tests, which shows why strong primality testing is critical in cybersecurity.

- user input and display execution time & memory usage — teaches both coding and algorithmic efficiency.
- 
- Uses only standard Python and runs instantly on any college computer with zero installation.
- 
- Connects 1st-year topics (loops, functions, recursion) directly to how the internet stays secure.
